            A cortado is a type of coffee beverage that originated in Spain. It consists of equal parts espresso coffee and warm milk. 
            The milk in a cortado is steamed, but not frothy like in a cappuccino or latte. The result is a smooth and rich coffee with a balanced taste, 
            perfect for those who enjoy the flavor of espresso but prefer a bit of milk to mellow it out.
             Cortados are typically served in small glasses or cups, and they're often enjoyed as a mid-morning or afternoon pick-me-up.</p>

        <p>Cappuccino is a creamy coffee beverage originating from Italy. Its name is believed to come from the brown robes worn by Capuchin monks, 
            resembling the color of the drink when mixed with milk. Made with equal parts espresso, steamed milk, 
            and milk foam, it offers a rich flavor and a frothy texture. 
            Cappuccinos are enjoyed worldwide as a classic coffee choice, often served in cafes and coffee shops.</p>

        <p>The flat white, a renowned coffee concoction, found its roots in either Australia or New Zealand during the vibrant cafe scene of the 1980s. 
            It quickly gained a devoted following for its unique combination of a robust espresso shot paired with creamy, velvety steamed milk, 
            served in a smaller cup compared to its latte counterpart. While its exact origins remain a topic of debate, it is often associated with the bustling coffee cultures of cities like Sydney and Auckland, 
            where numerous cafes lay claim to its invention. Despite the dispute over its birthplace, the flat white has transcended its regional beginnings to become a beloved staple in coffee culture worldwide, 
            admired for its smooth taste and luxurious texture.</p>

            The iced Americano, a popular coffee beverage, traces its origins back to World War II-era Italy. 
            Legend has it that American soldiers stationed in Italy found the local espresso too strong for their taste, 
            so they would dilute it with water to create a milder, more refreshing drink. This practice eventually evolved into the modern iced Americano, 
            which typically consists of espresso shots poured over ice and topped up with cold water. Its popularity has since spread worldwide, 
            with variations and adaptations to suit different preferences and cultures, but its essence remains a testament to the ingenuity of blending espresso with water to create a cool and invigorating coffee experience.</p>
